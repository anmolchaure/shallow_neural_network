# shallow_neural_network

Trainig one layer neural network and plotting accuracy and loss of training and validation datasets.

STEP 1: Import all libraries essential for the model

STEP 2: Generate random dataset using datasets from sklearn or upload availabe data from drive(applicable for google colab) or local machine

STEP 3: Feature Scaling of dataset

STEP 4: Split data for training and testing(validating)

STEP 5: (if required) define functions for activation function

STEP 6: Design the model accordingly and train it

STEP 7: extract the results(accuracy,loss,val_accuracy,val_loss) using history() function

STEP 8: (if required) export the results to local machine

STEP 9: Plot the accuracy and loss using matplotlib
